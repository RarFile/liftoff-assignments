## Submission Instructions

### Overview

    The FFXIV Recruit or just Recruit is a web app that works similar to a blog but is connected to a character
from the game Final Fantasy 14. It is meant to find those who are doing the same kind of content as the user currently using
it. The link between the poster and their character allow them to show their current equipment to prove they have the required
item level (Gear score) to do the content they are trying to join into. Along with that the posts allow others to join in
discussions with others who are also doing the same content to discuss strategy not just recruitment for said content.
This also would make it an ideal place for newer users to look up what is the ideal way to play against bosses.

    The reason I came up with this project was because there is no centralized place to recruit people for content on
Final Fantasy 14. Things like Discord and Reddit exist and works well for some but I feel like it could be a better
experience. Not only that but linking videos and strategies through forums based on specific content I believe is a
better sorting method and helps archive things for those who come and play at a later date.

### Technologies

PHP
Java
Javascript
MySQL


### What I'll Have to Learn

    The FFXIV API comes in a few flavours I decided to take the PHP version which I am totally unfamiliar with.
As for the page aesthetics I might be picking javascript for the front-end aesthetic to match the Final Fantasy 14 look.
